This is a real-time bidding agent using Scala and Akka toolkit.
A real-time bidding agent is a simple HTTP server that accepts JSON requests, does some matching between advertising campaigns and the received bid request and responds with either a JSON response with a matched campaign (bid) or an empty response (no bid).
